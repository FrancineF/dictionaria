<h2 id="How to search...">How to search...</h2>

<p>Dictionaria facilitates two kinds of searches:</p>

<ol>
<li>For the searches of headwords, meaning descriptions, and examples you type the word or multiwor
d expression into the search field, e.g. pull or pull out. The unmarked search finds the item, but
in addition all other items that contain the same string of characters. Thus eat does not only find
 'eat', but also 'beat' and 'creature'.
To narrow your searches by the use of the symbols listed in Table 1, in which x means any character
 or string of characters including space.

<table class="table table-bordered">
<caption>Table 1: Search options</caption>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>^x</td>
<td>search for a certain word or string of characters at the beginning of an entry, e.g. "^under",
which finds <em>under, underground, understand</em> etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>x$</td>
<td>search for a certain word or string of characters at the end of an entry, e.g. "fly$", which fi
nds <em>fly, butterfly,</em> etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>x_x</td>
<td>search for entries showing the string preceded and followed by any other character including wh
ite space, e.g. "_ea_" finds beach, tea leaf, burn / eat</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>^x$</td>
<td>search for a string of characters that fills the headword or meaning description from the begin
ning to the end. "^eat$" finds "eat" in the meaning description of the Daakaka dictionary, because
this consists only of "eat", but it does not find "eat" in the Teop meaning description, because th
is is "eat (something with something)"</td>

<li>For searches of parts of speech and semantic domains the dictionaries provide individual drop-d
own lists.</li>
</ol>

<table class="table table-bordered">
<caption>Table 2: Single column searches</caption>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Headword</td>
<td>
	<p>If you type a word into the ‘headword’ field, you will find this word listed together wi
th all other words that contain the same string of characters.</p>
	<p>For example, 'ep' (Daakaka) finds not only the headword 'ep', but also <em>akr<strong>ep
</strong></em>, <em>b<strong>ep</strong>ane</em> and <em>dokta ane <strong>ep</strong></em>.</p>
	<br>
	<p>You can narrow down your search by using the search option '^' directly followed by the
word you are looking for. This search will find the headword (if it is present in the dictionary) a
nd all other headword entries that begin with the characters of this headword.</p>
	<p>For example, if you search for '^ep', you will see the following entries: <em><strong>ep
¹, ep², ep</strong>mir, <strong>ep</strong>upuop</em>.</p>
	<br>
	<p>If you want to find all headwords ending in a particular string of characters, type the
string into the headword field and directly add '$' at the end of the string.</p>
	<p>For example, if you search for 'ep$' you will find <em>akr<strong>ep</strong>, dewen<strong>ep</strong></em> and <em>tuwu tr<strong>ep</strong></em>.</p>
	<br>
	<p>If you combine '^' and '$' as in '^ep$', you find <em>ep¹</em> and <em>ep²</em>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Meaning description</td>
<td>
	<p>If you type in a particular English word in the field 'meaning description', you will fi
nd all meaning descriptions that contain this string of characters at any position.</p>
	<p>For example, a search for 'man' will give you the entry for 'man' but also 'praying <strong>man</strong>tis' and 'hu<strong>man</strong> tongue' (Daakaka).</p>
	<br>
	<p>You can use the search option '^' directly followed by the word you are looking for. Thi
s will give you all meaning descriptions that start with the searched word.</p>
	<p>For example, if you search for ‘^man’, you will find the entry '<strong>man</strong>; pe
rson' but also '<strong>man</strong>go'.</p>
	<br>
	<p>If you type in '^man$, you will get no results, because '$' means 'end of entry' and the
 meaning descriptions are 'man; guy' for <em>teme</em> and 'man; person' for <em>vyante</em>.</p>

<tr>
<td>Part of speech</td>
<td>The drop-down list shows all word classes and in some dictionaries classes of affixes and types
    of multi-word constructions. The abbreviations are listed in the respective introduction of the dictionary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Semantic domain</td>
<td>The drop-down list shows a selection of semantic domains covered by the dictionary, for example
 'plants' in the Daakaka and the Teop dictionary or 'botanical' in the Hdi dictionary.</td>

<ol>
<li>Part of speech & meaning description
<br>
<p>For example, if you select 'v.tr' in 'part of speech' and enter 'hand' in 'meaning description'
in the Teop dictionary, you find:</p>
<br>
<p><em>atoato</em>		'catch something with one's <strong>hand</strong>s'</p>
<p><em>kae</em>			'hold something in one <strong>hand</strong>'</p>
<p><em>poto</em>		'grab something or catch something with one's <strong>hand</strong>
s'</p>
<br>
<p>In the Daakaka dictionary the search for 'v.tr' and 'hand' finds:</p>
<br>
<p><em>bwiti</em>		'break an elongated object in two with both <strong>hand</strong>s'
</p>
<p><em>kinkate</em>		'hold something in one <strong>hand</strong>'</p>
<p><em>sedisi</em>		'raise a weapon (in one <strong>hand</strong>) to hit someone</p>
<p><em>tiwiye</em>		'break (something which can be broken easily with two <strong>hand</strong>s)</p>
</li>

<li>Part of speech and semantic domain
<br>
<p>For example, if you select 'v.itr' and 'body' you find 7 entries in the Daakaka dictionary, e.g.
</p>
<br>
<p><em>banga</em>		'open one's mouth'</p>
<p><em>kyep</em>		'shit'</p>
<br>
<p>In the Teop dictionary the selection of 'v.intr' and 'body' finds 8 entried, e.g.</p>
<br>
<p><em>goroho</em>		'sleep'</p>
<p><em>kayuhu</em>		'spit'</p>

</li>
